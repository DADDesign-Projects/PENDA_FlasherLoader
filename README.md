Boot program for the **PENDA platform** combining a bootloader and a flasher client.

It allows:
- Storing into onboard QSPI flash memory:
  - ELF files of effect programs  
  - Associated dependencies (fonts, images, etc.)  
- Selecting which effect to launch at startup

At power-up, the bootloader automatically runs the selected effect.


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/DADDesign-Projects/PENDA_FLasherLoader
```
